You will need at least (there may be others):

	- ghc
	- cabal-install

To install to your local bin folder, run in theis directory:

	$ cabal install --prefix=$HOME --user

This should automatically pull in the rest of the dependencies.

Create a credentials file somewhere with the following format:

	Credentials
		{ user = "your_user_name"
		, password = "your_password"
		}

Then, to authenticate run:

	$ wifi_login path_to_credfile wlan0

where wlan0 is the interface you've connected with.

This can be easily ran from wicd or networkmanager with scripts
that I'll publish when I get round to it...
